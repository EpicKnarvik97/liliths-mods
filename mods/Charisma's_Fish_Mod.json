Well, it's been months, so I might as well release it as a mod. There are a few reasons this didn't end up in the base game. One is probably that the art could use some work. Another is the inconsistent furriness. The main one is my hacky, weird trick to give fins their own colors independent of the limbs they are on, by hijacking the color of the ears. If you have fish ears, you will be able to set the covering color of all of the fish fins on your body, which includes arms, legs, and tailfin.",
