Added a handful of Pokémon that a lot of people have been clamoring for. In addition, I've added a couple of notes that might appear in the alleyways. What could they mean??? (I'll elaborate on a later date, when I'm less tired) Also fixed a few bits and pieces here and there. One big thing was the racial essences, which I had to restructure a lotta parsing to fix. Full breakdown in the Changelog. Also, New pictures of the PokéThrone-tailored regional Lilithian Forms are included within the folder.",
